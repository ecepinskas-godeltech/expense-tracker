# petproject.dev

Welcome to the petproject.dev repository! This collection of projects is designed to help students and developers of all levels build practical skills through hands-on experience. By working on real-world applications, you’ll not only learn how to code but also how to solve problems, design systems, and deliver functional solutions.

What is Project-Based Learning?
Project-Based Learning (PBL) is an educational approach where students learn by actively engaging in meaningful projects. Instead of focusing solely on theory, PBL emphasizes practical application, critical thinking, and teamwork.

With this approach, you will:

Gain a deep understanding of concepts by applying them to real-world scenarios.
Build a portfolio of completed projects to showcase your skills.
Develop problem-solving abilities and learn best practices for software development.
Work through structured steps to incrementally develop and refine applications.
Each project is broken into manageable parts, making it easier to learn progressively and focus on specific technologies or methodologies.
