# petproject.dev

Welcome to the petproject.dev repository! This collection of projects is designed to help students and developers of all levels build practical skills through hands-on experience. By working on real-world applications, you’ll not only learn how to code but also how to solve problems, design systems, and deliver functional solutions.

## What is Project-Based Learning?
Project-Based Learning (PBL) is an educational approach where students learn by actively engaging in meaningful projects. Instead of focusing solely on theory, PBL emphasizes practical application, critical thinking, and teamwork.

With this approach, you will:

- Gain a deep understanding of concepts by applying them to real-world scenarios.
- Build a portfolio of completed projects to showcase your skills.
- Develop problem-solving abilities and learn best practices for software development.
- Work through structured steps to incrementally develop and refine applications.

Each project is broken into manageable parts, making it easier to learn progressively and focus on specific technologies or methodologies.

## How It Works
1. Choose a Project\
Explore the list of available projects in this repository and pick one that aligns with your learning goals. For example, you can start with the [Expense Tracker](./expense-tracker/README.md).
1. Fork the Starter Repository (Optional)\
If there is a starter in the project for the stack you have chosen, then fork it. Unfortunately, the starting project will not be suitable for every technology.
1. Work Task by Task\
Follow the step-by-step tasks outlined in the project README. These tasks are designed to incrementally guide you through the project, covering essential concepts and techniques.
1. Verify Your Work\
After completing all tasks, ensure that:
    * Everything meets the project requirements.
1. Request feedback from a Mentor by filling out the form at the last step\
Once you're confident in your work, request feedback from a mentor. Mentors provide invaluable guidance, helping you improve your solution and grow as a developer.
    * Work in a Development Branch: We highly recommend working in a separate dev branch rather than directly pushing to master. This way, you can open a Pull Request (PR) from your dev branch to master for review.
    * Code Review Process: Mentors will review your PR, suggest improvements, and work with you through multiple iterations until the solution meets expectations.


## Available Projects

1. [Expense Tracker](./expense-tracker/README.md)\
