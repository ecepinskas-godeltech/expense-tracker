# Expense Tracker

Expense Tracker is an educational project designed to help students learn the fundamentals of full-stack development. The project focuses on building a simple expense management application where users can add, edit, delete, and view expenses.

The project is split into multiple parts, each focusing on specific concepts and technologies, making it easier for students to learn step by step. By completing this project, students will:
- Gain hands-on experience with backend and frontend development.
- Learn to write clean, modular, and testable code.
- Practice setting up development environments, integrating APIs, and creating reusable components.
- Understand the importance of testing and how to write and run unit and integration tests.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three main parts:
- **Backend**: Focuses on creating APIs, setting up a database, and implementing business logic.
- **Frontend**: Covers the implementation of the user interface, reusable components, and client-side logic.

This division helps students concentrate on specific areas of development, making the learning process more manageable and structured. Additionally, students can choose to work on only the backend or frontend if they prefer to specialize.
