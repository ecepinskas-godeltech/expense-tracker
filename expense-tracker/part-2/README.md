- Created a migration that successfully creates a new table after running. Running the migration again does not lead to anything.
- `auth` module is created with controller, service, and repository.
- `user` module is created with controller, service, and repository.

**Materials:**

- [What are database migrations?](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/types/relational/what-are-database-migrations)
